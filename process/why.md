# Why?

## v0.1 -- Wednesday, 10 July 2024

Main point: **I don't know yet**. But.

It seems like I'm leaning more and more into some sort of **exploration of conventional game design space**. As in "fun"? Why do that? Because a game that explores mechanics/assets/etc.s in the context of fun is a nice way to explore those concepts "for real"?

Also, I don't normally make work that's about a compelling/fun experience so this **feels like a risky/embarrassing but worthwhile experiment simply in the context of my own "practice"** as a game designer. "Doing it properly."

It's also intended as a partway **tribute to Poppy Games**.

More and more seeing it as an **opportunity to read and action game design knowledge**, something I've largely stayed the hell away from over the years.
